          <h5>Q1. How do I sign up?</h5>
          <p>A1. <i>First</i>, carefully read the <a href="Townathlon_Waiver.pdf">liability waiver</a>. You will sign the hard copy of the waiver during registration. <br><i>Second</i>, pay the registration fee (rates per participant are $40 for working adults, $20 for students). You can pay online <b>here</b> or stop by at ASWWU office. AND don't forget that you can pay the fee on the day event, just come about an hour before the run. It is also a good option for those procrastinating friends of yours. <br><i>Finally</i>, SHOW UP with your ID which we will match to the list of those who paid in advance. IDs are required of all, even if you are paying on the day of the event. Sign the waiver, get the bib number, warm up with us and....HAVE FUN!!!!</p>

          <h5>Q2. How old should I be to participate in TNT?</h5>
          <p>A2. You must be 14 years of age or older on the day of the event. </p>

              <h5>Q3. What should I wear?</h5>
              <p>A3. We highly recommend the following outfit:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A <b>hat</b> that you got somewhere for free - to protect you from branches, mud, camouflage net, etc</li>
                <li><b>GLOVES</b> - tight fitting work or fitness gloves to protect your hands</li>
                <li>A bright not-so-new <b>t-shirt</b> + a <b>long sleeve tight</b> fitting <b>undershirt</b> - to stick your number to, to help us see you and to reduce scraping</li>
                <li>Older <b>shorts</b> or <b>pants</b> - to allow free movement in multiple directions, protect your thighs and look good in pictures</li>
                <li>Experienced <b>trail running shoes</b> - to give you a grip on the various terrains and to protect your feet during water crossing</li>
                <li><b>Socks</b> - thick to prevent blisters, but not too long to collect thorns</li>
              </ul>

          <h5>Q4. What happens if the weather is bad on the day of the TNT?</h5>
          <p>A4. TNT run is rain or shine event. However, TNT management reserves the right to change or alter the course, postpone or cancel the event at any time for logistical, weather or safety reasons. </p>

          <h5>Q5. Where is the start and finish and, in general, what is the route of the TNT?</h5>
          <p>A5. You can find the map for the run <a href="tnt_map.jpg">here</a>. In broad terms, the runners will start in the large open field adjacent to Walla Walla Community College athletic fields, head towards the Mill creek, cross the creek, then run up the hill towards the Bennington Lake, circle the lake, run in the dried out creek, get to the Diversion Canal, climb out of the canal, and then turn back towards the Bennington Lake and back to the start and finish line, thus completing the loop and their TNT experience. We will make every effort to guide you through the course with hurdles, signs and volunteers, but it is your responsibility to know and understand the course and, naturally, stay on it. </p>

              <p>A6. 8 miles</p>

              <h5>Q7. 8 miles???</h5>
              <p>A7. Yes, but it is a run, not a race. The effort decision is yours to make. </p>
